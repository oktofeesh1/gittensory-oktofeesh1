// Public "proof of power" stats (#1059) — a small, public-safe aggregate of what gittensory's REVIEW SYSTEM has
// done, powering the above-the-fold homepage counter. Flag-gated by GITTENSORY_PUBLIC_STATS (default OFF): when
// off the public endpoint 404s, so the deploy is byte-identical to today until the flag is deliberately set.
//
// REALTIME: queries the live ledger directly (no rollup/cron) so a new review shows up within the 60s HTTP cache
// window. "reviewed" = a distinct PR for which the review system published a public review surface (audit_events
// `github_app.pr_public_surface_published`, scoped to the repos it handles: gittensory, awesome-claude,
// metagraphed); each PR's terminal DISPOSITION is read from the pull_requests cache. (The legacy review_targets
// ledger this used to read was orphaned by the convergence cutover — nothing writes it anymore.)
//
// DISPOSITIONS: merged (merged_at set) / closed (closed without a merge) = the review system auto-actioned;
// commented = still-open reviewed PRs (reviewed + advised, awaiting a maintainer / CI). Reviewed PRs that never
// got a published surface (skipped drafts/bots, errors) simply don't appear — there is no ignored/manual/error.
//   reviewed   = merged + closed + commented            (every distinct PR a review surface was published for)
//   filteredPct = (reviewed - merged) / reviewed         (share resolved WITHOUT a merge — noise kept off humans)
//   accuracyPct = 1 - reversed / (merged + closed)       (reversed = engine auto-actions a human overturned, live)
//   minutesSaved = reviewed * MINUTES_SAVED_PER_PR        (estimated maintainer review time saved)
//
// PRIVACY: counts only — no PR content, authors, scores, or reward internals. Safe to serve publicly.
//
// GLOBAL: the homepage total folds in every EXTERNAL registered Orb installation's outcomes (getOrbGlobalStats),
// so the counter is worldwide, not just gittensory's own repos. JSONbored is counted here via the cloud ledger,
// so it's excluded from the Orb side to avoid double-counting.
